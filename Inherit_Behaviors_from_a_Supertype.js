//Inherit Behaviors from a Supertype

//Question:-Object.create(obj) creates a new object, and sets obj as the new object's prototype. Recall that the prototype is like the "recipe" for creating an object. By setting the prototype of animal to be the prototype of Animal, you are effectively giving the animal instance the same "recipe" as any other instance of Animal.


function Animal() { }

Animal.prototype = {
  constructor: Animal,
  eat: function() {
    console.log("nom nom nom");
  }
};

// Only change code below this line

let duck=Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
let beagle=Object.create(Animal.prototype); // Change this line
